        <h1>Brief Introduction to Graphics Design</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Graphic design is an international language composed of signs and symbols, 
            marks and logos, banners and billboards, pictures and words. As visual 
            communicators, graphic designers maintain a delicate balance between clarity 
            and innovation: if too much of the former is a snooze, too much of the latter 
            yields chaos. In between lies a complex series of negotiations which lead, in 
            turn, to a host of applications —the same logo engraved on an envelope one day, 
            emblazoned on a truck the next— and therein lies the designer’s peculiar, if 
            paradoxical challenge. Succeed, and the world works a little better as a result. 
            Fail, and — well, you’ve got the butterfly ballot.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In addition to their role in the visual engineering of most printed matter, 
            graphic designers today lend their expertise to a host of related disciplines 
            including, but not limited to, strategy and consulting, information and experience 
            design, branding and broadcast design, and signage and wayfinding systems. They are 
            groomed to acquire a certain classic set of skills (which today demand a facility with
            software) including drawing, photography, composition and typography — the design and 
            structural characteristics of letterforms, arguably graphic design’s lingua franca.</p>
